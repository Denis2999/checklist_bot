# checklist_bot
Checklist bot which sent what workers should to do at the start and the end of workday. It's a Telegram bot for group conversation.

Two times a day, bot sents messages. It's a reminder if worker didn't forget to wash workplace, take out the trash etc.
After taping "Done" text turns into ~~strikethrough~~ and it couls visible, who did it. 
It helps to maintain discipline and keep the workplace clean at work and saves paper.
