Checklist bot which sent what workers should do at the start and the end of the workday. It's a Telegram bot for group conversation.

Two times a day, the bot sends messages. It's a reminder that workers didn't forget to wash the workplace, take out the trash, etc. After taping "Done" the text turns into a ~~strikethrough~~ and it could be visible, who did it. It helps to maintain discipline and keep the workplace clean at work and saves paper.
